            I’m Shubh Gupta, a passionate and dedicated Web
             Developer  with strong skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I 
             specialize in building responsive, user-friendly, and visually 
             appealing websites that provide smooth and engaging user 
             experiences across all devices. I focus on writing clean, 
             structured, and efficient code while ensuring modern design 
             principles are applied to every project I create. I enjoy 
             transforming ideas into functional digital solutions and 
             constantly challenge myself to learn new technologies and 
             improve my development skills. With a strong commitment to 
             continuous learning and growth, I aim to build impactful web
              experiences that not only look great but also perform 
              exceptionally well.
