            I am Shubh Gupta, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science (2026), with a deep interest in web development and software technologies. I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on writing clean, structured code and designing smooth user experiences across different devices. With a strong foundation in computer science principles and a continuous learning mindset, I am committed to enhancing my technical expertise and building impactful web solutions. My aim is to grow into a proficient full-stack developer and contribute to innovative and meaningful projects.
            <br> <br>I work primarily with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and I am continuously expanding my knowledge of modern development tools and frameworks. I have built projects such as TextUtils, a text utility application that performs text transformations and analysis, and Current Chronicle, a responsive news application that delivers real-time news updates with category-based filtering and a clean user interface. These projects reflect my ability to apply frontend and backend concepts to create practical, performance-oriented applications.
            <br><br>You can explore more of my work and development journey on my GitHub profile, where I regularly upload and maintain my projects, including TextUtils and Current Chronicle. My GitHub repositories reflect my approach to clean code, structured project architecture, and continuous improvement as a developer. I actively use version control to manage my projects efficiently and document my learning progress. Feel free to visit my GitHub to review the source code, project implementations, and future updates as I continue expanding my technical expertise.
